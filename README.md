# ContactFormPHP
Contact form using HTML, CSS, and PHP

This form requires the user's name, email address, and a message. 
To prevent spammers, there is a hidden input area that is checked on submit whether input has been added or not.

If no input has been added, an email is sent. Otherwise display an alert saying Message Sent without sending the email.

Feel free to take this and run with it for whatever you may need it for.
